# Massdrop Ctrl bluspikez

Based on the endgame layout, but tweaked with the features that I prefer.

Core changes:
 - removal of layers that I won't use (mouse & program specific keys - git, vim, etc)
 - removal of features I won't use (tapdance and dynamic macros)
 - tweaks to default values (adjustment to enabled LED patterns; custom default value for LED RGB; enable LED timeout and adjust timeout length)
 - change layer lighting to only light used function keys; light backspace & backslash as examples for LED setting selection
 
 TODO:
  - remap right-hand modifier keys (Fn immediately right of spacebar; custom values on R-alt, R-ctrl, R-shift and context menu keys - like `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`
  - assign preset RGB colors/patterns to Fn[1-8]
